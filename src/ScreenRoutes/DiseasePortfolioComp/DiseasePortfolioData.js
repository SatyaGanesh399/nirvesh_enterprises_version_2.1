    description: `A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a sudden injury that causes brain damage. It can happen as a result of a blow, bump, or jolt to the head. A closed head injury has occurred. A TBI can also occur when an object enters the skull. This is a serious wound.
      TBI symptoms can be mild, moderate, or severe. Concussions are a type of mild traumatic brain injury. Concussions can have serious consequences, but most people recover completely. Serious physical and psychological symptoms, coma, and even death can result from more severe TBI.
      Who is vulnerable to traumatic brain injury (TBI)?
      ·	TBI is more common in the following groups:
      ·	Men are more likely than women to sustain a TBI. They are also more likely to suffer from severe TBI.
      ·	Adults 65 and older are most likely to be hospitalized and die as a result of a TBI.
      Long-Term Effects of Traumatic Injury
      
      The long term effects of TBI vary depending on where the trauma occurred in the brain. 
      Damage to the frontal lobe or forehead area, which regulates reasoning, problem solving, judgment, impulse control, and planning, can lead to risky or inappropriate behavior. 
      Trauma to the left side of the brain can result in problems with logic, speech difficulties, difficulty understanding others or talking, whereas injury to the right side can result in problems processing visual information, neglect, or apraxia - the ability to perform regular or familiar tasks. 
      For instance, if you give someone a pen, they can tell you what it is but not how to use it.
      The long-term effects of head trauma are also affected by the severity of the trauma. Long-term consequences of severe TBI may include:
      ·	Memory lapses
      ·	Headaches
      ·	Seizures
      ·	Dizziness
      ·	Visual modifications
      ·	Fatigue
      ·	Paralysis
      ·	Problems with balance
      ·	Language skills have deteriorated.
      ·	Swings in mood

      Rehabilitation
      
      People with severe TBI are frequently transferred to a rehabilitation centre after the acute care period of in-hospital treatment, where a multidisciplinary team of health care providers assists with recovery.
      Neurologists, nurses, psychologists, nutritionists, as well as physical, occupational, vocational, speech, and respiratory therapists, make up the rehabilitation team.
      Therapy aims to improve a person's ability to handle daily activities and to address cognitive, physical, occupational, and emotional difficulties. 
      Treatment may be required only temporarily or for the rest of a person's life. 
      Outpatient services are used to provide some therapy.
      Cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) is an approach that uses an individualised training programme to help people regain normal brain function. People who use this strategy may also learn corrective strategies for coping with enduring deficits in memory, problem solving, and thinking skills. CRT programmes are typically highly individualised, with varying degrees of success. According to a 2011 Institute of Medicine report, cognitive rehabilitation interventions must be developed and evaluated more thoroughly.

    description: `Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures the small changes in blood flow that occur with brain activity. It may be used to examine which parts of the brain are handling critical functions, evaluate the effects of stroke or other disease, or to guide brain treatment. fMRI may detect abnormalities within the brain that cannot be found with other imaging techniques.

      Tell your doctor about any health problems, recent surgeries, or allergies, and whether there's a possibility you are pregnant. The magnetic field is not harmful, but it may cause some medical devices to malfunction. Most orthopedic implants and stents pose no risk, but you should always tell the technologist if you have any devices or metal in your body. Guidelines about eating and drinking before your exam vary between facilities. Unless you are told otherwise, take your regular medications as usual and try to maintain your typical habits for drinking caffeinated beverages (especially coffee). For example, if you normally drink coffee every morning, try not to skip it on the day of your exam. If you rarely drink coffee, try to avoid it on the day of your exam. Leave jewelry at home and wear loose, comfortable clothing. You may need to change into a gown for the procedure.
      
      What are some common uses of the procedure?
      Doctors use fMRI to learn how a normal, diseased or injured brain is working. They may also use it to assess the potential risks of surgery or other invasive brain treatments. While doctors may use fMRI to research many conditions, the FDA has only approved the use of fMRI for surgical planning.

      Your doctor may order an fMRI to:

      Determine which part of the brain is handling critical functions such as thought, speech, movement and sensation, which is called brain mapping. Studying which parts of the brain are involved in certain functions of our body is called functional anatomy.
      Help assess the effects of stroke, trauma, or degenerative disease (such as Alzheimer's) on brain function.
      Monitor the growth and function of brain tumors.

    description : 
    `Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public-health concern. To understand the extent of TBI, it is important to assess the prevalence of TBI in the general population. However, the prevalence of TBI in the general population can be difficult to measure because of differing definitions of TBI, differing TBI severity levels, and underreporting of sport-related TBI. Additionally, prevalence reports vary from study to study. In this present study, we used meta-analytic methods to estimate the prevalence of TBI in the adult general population. Across 15 studies, all originating from developed countries, which included 25,134 adults, 12% had a history of TBI. Men had more than twice the odds of having had a TBI than did women, suggesting that male gender is a risk factor for TBI. The adverse behavioral, cognitive and psychiatric effects associated with TBI coupled with the high prevalence of TBI identified in this study indicate that TBI is a considerable public and personal-health problem.
    
    An estimated 1.5-2 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) every year in the USA alone [1], where TBIs account for approximately 1.4 million emergency room visits, 275,000 hospital admissions, and 52,000 deaths each year [2]. The resultant personal and social costs are high, with some estimates suggesting that costs associated with TBI are between 9 and 10 billion dollars annually [1].

While incidence rates for TBI are readily available, there is comparatively little information about the prevalence of TBI in the general population. TBI presents several unique issues when attempting to estimate prevalence. One problem in estimating the prevalence of TBI is the amorphous nature of head injury: TBI diagnosis can range from mild to severe, with signs and symptoms varying across and within severity levels. Further, the distinction between mild and moderate and moderate and severe TBI is often unclear. A second area of concern is that multiple methods are used to diagnose TBI severity, including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, length of posttraumatic amnesia (PTA), and presence or absence of loss of consciousness (LOC) at the time of injury [3]. The definitional and diagnostic ambiguity surrounding TBI results in inconsistent reports about incidence rates and residual effects of TBI [4]. Finally, TBI is associated with specific subgroups of the population - the young, the elderly, adolescent males, lower socioeconomic groups, minorities and those who drink alcohol are all at greater risk of TBI than is the general population [5,6].

Given the difficulties in diagnosing TBI, it can be difficult to estimate accurate TBI prevalence; understandably, TBI prevalence varies from study to study, particularly when attempting to estimate TBI prevalence in the general population. For example, in one sample of 20 healthy African-American males with an average age of 32.6 years and an average of 12.7 years of education assessed with a questionnaire, 60% reported a history of TBI [7]. In contrast, using a large cross-sectional community sample and operationalizing TBI as having had a serious head injury with resultant loss of consciousness of 15 min or more, Butterworth et al. [8] found a TBI prevalence of only 5.7% in 7,488 subjects. To better understand the prevalence of TBI in the general population, we performed a meta-analysis of published studies that reported TBI prevalence in the general adult population.

Smith et al investigated the patient care of primary caregivers one year after a stroke and discovered that caregivers oftently lacked the knowledge and skills needed to provide home care after patients were discharged; additionally, they had to gather relevant data and assistance on their own. 
Caregivers must adjust to the changes brought on by the patient's illness. 
Unmet needs have been discovered in studies of stroke patients' and family caregivers' home care needs.

Examine your insurance options and your financial situation.
The majority of hospitalisation and rehabilitation costs will be covered by health insurance.
However, which facilities and providers are covered may be limited. 
So, make sure you understand exactly what is covered and what out-of-pocket expenses may be required. 
Also, keep in mind that as your loved one gains abilities or stops progressing, coverage may change or cease. 
A case manager or the hospital's social service department can assist you in navigating the often complex world of insurance and exploring other options if you require additional assistance.

Take part in stroke rehabilitation.
Join a few therapy sessions to help your loved one recover from a stroke. 
Motivate the stroke survivor to practise new skills, but don't always offer to assist. 
Expect survivors to do things for own selves while remaining supportive. 
Even minor achievements will assist your loved one become more self-sufficient and confident.

Examine your loved one's requirements as well as their ability to meet them. 
The stroke survivor's medical team can assist you in determining what type of assistance is required. 
Caregivers are frequently required to:
1. perform personal care tasks such as taking a shower and dressing
2. coordinate health-care needs, such as medication and doctor and rehabilitation appointments
3. keep track of finances and health insurance
4. assist the survivor in maintaining and improving their capacity to perform

It's better to learn than to miss out. 
Keep track of your loved one's medications and side effects. 
Determine whether your residence should be revised to accommodate the needs of a stroke survivor. 
Inquire with a doctor, nurse, or therapist about what to anticipate.

Gains can occur quickly or gradually. 
The most rapid recovery appears to occur during the first three to four months after a stroke, but some survivors continue to recover well into the first and second years.

    description : `Reviewing epidemiological data facilitates the development of preventive strategies by identifying the main causes of traumatic brain injury, the factors contributing to severity, the most prevalent age groups and other demographics of the risk groups. 

Understanding both the incidence and severity, in conjunction with identification of the mechanism of injury, allow us to design appropriate health care services from subacute and emergency medicine to neurorehabilitation and so determine the training needs of the healthcare workforce. It also allows us to estimate future socioeconomic needs to minimise the burden on wider society and governments.
The primary causes of traumatic brain injury vary by age, socioeconomic factors, and geographic region, so any planned interventions must take into account this variability. The low and medium-income countries (LMICs) experience nearly three times more cases of traumatic brain injury proportionally than high-income countries (HICs), with Southeast Asian and Western Pacific regions experiencing the greatest overall burden. [4]

Age-related traumatic brain injury differences demonstrate three main age groups with the highest prevalence:

Early childhood (falls being the main cause)
Late adolescence / early adulthood (road traffic accidents (RTAs) being the main cause)
Elderly (falls being the main cause)
Childhood injuries are most likely in the poorest countries with WHO claiming 98% occurrence in LMIC and 5 times greater frequency than in industrialised nations. [1] In the last 20 years there is an increased incidence of falls amongst the elderly. Gender differences also show a global trend with males being more prevalent with rates from 1.5:1 to 2.5:1 across the world, apart from the 8th and 9th decade of life.

In recent research, falls have been identified as the main cause of traumatic brain injury (attributable traumas increased from 43% to 54% between 2003 and 2012), followed by road traffic accidents (attributable traumas dropped from 39% in 2003 to 24% in 2012) [5], violence, sports-related injuries, and work-related injuries. 

The dominant cause of traumatic brain injury can vary depending on the countries’ income, geographical region and political circumstances (i.e.conflict areas). The proportion of traumatic brain injury resulting from road traffic collisions is greatest in Africa and Southeast Asia (both 56%) and lowest in North America (25%), while South America, the Caribbean and Sub Saharan Africa represent the highest world incidence of traumatic brain injury-related to violence.

There is some discrepancy with rural and urban traumatic brain injury incidence, respectively being 9.7 and 6.3 per 100,000 population following China based studies, and 172.1 and 97.8 per 100,000 following USA based studies. [1]

Brain injury is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with traumatic brain injury being the leading cause of seizure disorders. However, in recent years we have observed a decrease in mortality post-traumatic brain injury.

The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is determined by the severity of traumatic brain injury and age and is as follows: 

General CFR ranges from 0.9 to 7.6 per 100 traumatic brain injury patients
CFR of severe traumatic brain injury ranges from 29 to 55 per 100 traumatic brain injury patients
Average mortality is 10.53 per 100,000 population per year, with 68% of the individuals dying before reaching a hospital.
There is a close link between traumatic brain injury and alcohol consumption. In the UK the incidence of head injury in acutely intoxicated patients is estimated to be as high as 65%. In Asia, a substantial amount of night time RTAs in Asia are alcohol-related (10-30% depending on the country). [1] Alcohol intoxication also imposes serious diagnostic difficulties post-traumatic brain injury.

It is estimated that 80% of individuals living with traumatic brain injury-related impairment live in LMIC, but at the same time in those regions, only 2% of these have access to rehabilitation services so support their quality of life. Higher-income countries have been successfully decreasing the numbers of both overall traumatic brain injury and traumatic brain injury-related impairments following implementation of preventive measures, more rigorous safety measures, legislative changes, educating the general population, improved emergency and neuro-trauma services, and the implementation of evidence-based guidelines in treating survivors of traumatic brain injury.

    description: `Influence of music on brain health Listening to music can be enjoyable, and some research indicates that it may even be beneficial to your health. Music can provide pleasure and contentment, but it also has numerous psychological benefits. Music has the ability to relax the mind, energize the body, and even better cope with pain. Music's psychological effects can be profound and far-reaching. Music therapy is a treatment that is sometimes used to enhance mental well-being, assist patients in coping with stress, and improve psychological well-being. Some researchers suggest that your musical tastes can reveal information about various facets of your personality.
      
      Here are some potential benefits that music is said to have on the brain:
      1. Improve your mood and motivation. 
      2. Reduce stress. 
      3. Improve focus. 
      4. Boost your mood and motivation. 
      5. Lessen anxiety and depression. 
      6. Music Has the Potential to Improve Cognitive Performance. 
      7. Music Can Assist in Pain Management. 
      8. Music can help with enhancement of memory. 
      9. Music Can Lead To greater productivity. 
      10. Music Can Help You Perform Better and Last Longer. 
      
      According to research, music can have a positive effect on brain chemicals such as dopamine, which is associated with pleasantness, and oxytocin, the so-called 'love hormone.' Furthermore, there is some evidence that music can help reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol.Music therapy in Brain Stroke treatment Music is a multimodal stimulus that induces many brain structures associated to sensory processing, attention, and memory, as well as complex cognition and multisensory integration. Stroke is one of the most expensive and long-term disabling conditions in adulthood worldwide, and the effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes must be determined. The brain has a high capacity for instantaneous simultaneous sensory processing and integration. Musical training has a wide range of effects on the brain. Musicians have enhanced subcortical auditory and audiovisual processing of speech and music, which may be relevant for stroke rehabilitation. Listening to soothing music activates a system of subcortical and cortical regions of the brain.Music therapy in Traumatic Brain Injury 'Neurologic music therapy' (NMT)has been devised as a systematic treatment method based on scientific findings to optimise sensorimotor, language, and cognitive domains of operating through music. A preliminary study examining the effect of NMT on cognitive rehabilitation found promising results in improving executive functions, improving emotion regulation, and decreasing depression and anxiety after TBI. Music-based tailored experience have shown impressive outcomes in the rehabilitation of movement and gait issues. It has been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety, depression, agitation, and inducing a stable mood state. Enhanced adaptive behaviour following music-based interference has been observed in both adult and paediatric populations, even during coma recovery.`,
